2.	C.R.O (20MHz)

3.	Function generator (1MHz).

4.	Connecting cords & probes.

5.	PC with windows(95/98/XP/NT/2000)

6.	MATLAB Software with communication toolbox

THEORY:

Modulation is defined as the process of changing the characteristics (Amplitude, Frequency or Phase) of the carrier signal (high frequency signal) in accordance with the intensity of the message signal (modulating signal).
Amplitude modulation is defined as a system of modulation in which the amplitude of the carrier is varied in accordance with amplitude of the message signal (modulating signal).
The message signal is given by the expression. Em(t) =Em cosWmt
Where Wm is -----> Angular frequency Em --------→ Amplitude
Carrier voltage  Ec(t)= Ec cosWct E(t)=Ec + KaEm cosWmt
KaEm cosWmt -----→ change in carrier amplitude Ka-----→ constant
The amplitude modulated voltage is given by E=E(t) cosWct
From above two equations

E= ( Ec+KaEm cosWmt) cosWct.
